  Binary Search tree
In this article, we will discuss the Binary search tree. This article will be very helpful and informative to the students with technical background as it is an important topic of their course.

Before moving directly to the binary search tree, let's first see a brief description of the tree.

What is a tree?
A tree is a kind of data structure that is used to represent the data in hierarchical form. It can be defined as a collection of objects or entities called as nodes that are linked together to simulate a hierarchy. Tree is a non-linear data structure as the data in a tree is not stored linearly or sequentially.

Now, let's start the topic, the Binary Search tree.
