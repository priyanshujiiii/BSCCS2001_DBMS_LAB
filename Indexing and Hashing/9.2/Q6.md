<h1>AVL Tree</h1>
<h3>
AVL Tree is invented by GM Adelson - Velsky and EM Landis in 1962. The tree is named AVL in honour of its inventors.

AVL Tree can be defined as height balanced binary search tree in which each node is associated with a balance factor which is calculated by subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from that of its left sub-tree.

Tree is said to be balanced if balance factor of each node is in between -1 to 1, otherwise, the tree will be unbalanced and need to be balanced.

<h1>Randomized Binary Search Algorithm</h1>
<h3>We are given a sorted array A[] of n elements. We need to find if x is present in A or not.In binary search we always used middle element, here we will randomly pick one element in given range.

In Binary Search we had

middle = (start + end)/2
In Randomized binary search we do following

Generate a random number t
Since range of number in which we want a random
number is [start, end]
Hence we do, t = t % (end-start+1)
Then, t = start + t;
Hence t is a random number between start and end
It is a Las Vegas randomized algorithm as it always finds the correct result.

<h1>Skip list</h1>
<h3>Can we search in a sorted linked list better than O(n) time? The worst-case search time for a sorted linked list is O(n) as we can only linearly traverse the list and cannot skip nodes while searching. For a Balanced Binary Search Tree, we skip almost half of the nodes after one comparison with the root. For a sorted array, we have random access and we can apply Binary Search on arrays. Can we augment sorted linked lists to search faster? The answer is Skip List. The idea is simple, we create multiple layers so that we can skip some nodes. See the following example list with 16 nodes and two layers. The upper layer works as an “express lane” that connects only the main outer stations, and the lower layer works as a “normal lane” that connects every station. Suppose we want to search for 50, we start from the first node of the “express lane” and keep moving on the “express lane” till we find a node whose next is greater than 50. Once we find such a node (30 is the node in the following example) on “express lane”, we move to “normal lane” using a pointer from this node, and linearly search for 50 on “normal lane”. In the following example, we start from 30 on the “normal lane” and with linear search, we find 50. </h3>
<h1>Splay.</h1>
<h3>Splay Tree
Splay trees are the self-balancing or self-adjusted binary search trees. In other words, we can say that the splay trees are the variants of the binary search trees. The prerequisite for the splay trees that we should know about the binary search trees.

As we already know, the time complexity of a binary search tree in every case. The time complexity of a binary search tree in the average case is O(logn) and the time complexity in the worst case is O(n). In a binary search tree, the value of the left subtree is smaller than the root node, and the value of the right subtree is greater than the root node; in such case, the time complexity would be O(logn). If the binary tree is left-skewed or right-skewed, then the time complexity would be O(n). To limit the skewness, the AVL and Red-Black tree came into the picture, having O(logn) time complexity for all the operations in all the cases. We can also improve this time complexity by doing more practical implementations, so the new Tree data structure was designed, known as a Splay tree.</h3>
