<h1>AVL Tree</h1>
<h3>
AVL Tree is invented by GM Adelson - Velsky and EM Landis in 1962. The tree is named AVL in honour of its inventors.

AVL Tree can be defined as height balanced binary search tree in which each node is associated with a balance factor which is calculated by subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from that of its left sub-tree.

Tree is said to be balanced if balance factor of each node is in between -1 to 1, otherwise, the tree will be unbalanced and need to be balanced.

<h1>Randomized Binary Search Algorithm</h1>
<h3>We are given a sorted array A[] of n elements. We need to find if x is present in A or not.In binary search we always used middle element, here we will randomly pick one element in given range.

In Binary Search we had

middle = (start + end)/2
In Randomized binary search we do following

Generate a random number t
Since range of number in which we want a random
number is [start, end]
Hence we do, t = t % (end-start+1)
Then, t = start + t;
Hence t is a random number between start and end
It is a Las Vegas randomized algorithm as it always finds the correct result.
