<h1>Primary Index is an ordered file whose records are of fixed length with two fields. The first field of the index replicates the primary 
  key of the data file in an ordered manner,and the second field of the ordered file contains a pointer that points to the data-block where 
  a record containing the key is available.
</h1>
<h1>A dense index is a sequence of blocks that can hold only keys and pointers. here all records have a record in the index that point to 
  them i.e. it's created by sorting all tuples by some attribute, say, primary key
