<h1>Primary Index is an ordered file whose records are of fixed length with two fields. The first field of the index replicates the primary 
  key of the data file in an ordered manner,and the second field of the ordered file contains a pointer that points to the data-block where 
  a record containing the key is available.

<h1>A dense index is a sequence of blocks that can hold only keys and pointers. here all records have a record in the index that point to 
  them i.e. it's created by sorting all tuples by some attribute, say, primary key

<h1>Sparse Index It is an index record that appears for only some of the values in the file. Sparse Index helps you to resolve the issues of dense Indexing in DBMS. In this method of indexing technique, a range of index columns stores the same data block address, and when data needs to be retrieved, the block address will be fetched.

<h1>Secondary index is a type of dense index and also called a non clustering index. Secondary mapping size will be small as the two levels DB indexing is used. While creating the index, generally the index table is kept in the primary memory and the main table is kept in secondary memory because of its size.
