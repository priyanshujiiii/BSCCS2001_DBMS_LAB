<h1>Sparse Indexes:
Sparse indexes only contain entries for documents that have the indexed field, even if the index field contains a null value. The index skips over any document that is missing the indexed field. The index is "sparse" because it does not include all documents of a collection. By contrast, non-sparse indexes contain all documents in a collection, storing null values for those documents that do not contain the indexed field.

<h1>A dense index is a sequence of blocks that can hold only keys and pointers. here all records have a record in the index that point to them i.e. it's created by sorting all tuples by some attribute, say, primary key
