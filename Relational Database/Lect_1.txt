Reduancy : Multiple copies of Data
Anamoly : inconsistency of data arises due to change of data in data bases.

Single correct:

1) Which among the following is not a feature of a good database design?

>>A>> The design should provide efficient access to data.

>>B>> The design must promote redundant storage of the data items.

>>C>> The design must be clean, consistent, and easy to understand.

>>D>> The design must consider all expected data over time.

Discussion:

>>B>> The design must promote redundant storage of the data items.
 if we discussed about option b. we clearly seeing that redundant storage are multiple copies of data.
 another thing is if we discussed about good data base reduanant storage make database inconsisent this lead 
 sign of bad data base.
 
ANS: >>B>>

2) Which among the following statements is/are true about redundancy in databases?

>>A>> Redundancy may result in data anomaly.

>>b>> Redundancy may arise due to an un-normalized database.

>>C>> Redundancy mandates that a data item cannot have multiple copies in the database.

>>D>> Redundancy can be reduced by appropriate decomposition of relations.

Here this problem covering 5 concepts :Redundancy , anamoly , data anomaly , un-normalized database, decomposition of relation.
first fall here we are covering the all these concept
1) Redundancy : Multiple copies of Data

2) Anamoly : inconsistency of data arises due to change of data in data bases.
             Anamoly are in 3 types. 1) Insertions Anomaly : When the insertion of a data record is not possible without adding some additional
                                        unrelated data to the record
                                     2) Deletion Anomaly : When deletion of a data record results in losing some unrelated information that
                                        was stored as part of the record that was deleted from a table
                                     3) Update Anomaly : When a data is changed, which could involve many records having to be changed,
                                        leading to the possibility of some changes being made incorrectly
                                        
3) Data Anamoly: inconsistency of data arises due to change of data in data bases.

4)  un-normalized database: If a database design is not perfect, it may contain anomalies, which are like a bad dream for any database administrator. Managing a database with anomalies is next to impossible. Anamoly are in 3 types.  1) Insertions Anomaly 2) Deletion Anomaly 3) Update Anomaly 

5)  decomposition of relation: 
    Relational Decomposition
    >> When a relation in the relational model is not in appropriate normal form then the decomposition of a relation is required.
    >> In a database, it breaks the table into multiple tables.
    >> If the relation has no proper decomposition, then it may lead to problems like loss of information.
    >> Decomposition is used to eliminate some of the problems of bad design like anomalies, inconsistencies, and redundancy.
    
    Relational Decomposition are in 2 types: 1) Lossless Decomposition 2) Dependency Preserving
    
    
 Discussion: If we understand the above concepts and question option >>C>> is contradicting.
 
 ANS: A,B and D.

3) Which of the following is not a data anomaly?

>>A>> Select anomaly

>>B>> Insertion anomaly.

>>C>> Deletion anomaly.

>>D>> Update anomaly

Discussion:

Anomaly: inconsistencies that can arise due to data changes in a database with
insertion, deletion, and update
Anamoly are in 3 types.  1) Insertions Anomaly 2) Deletion Anomaly 3) Update Anomaly 

ANS: A

4) In a database, changing a single data may require changing many records, leading to the possibility of some changes being made incorrectly.
This situation can be described as ...............

>>A>> Select anomaly

>>B>> Insertions anomaly.

>>C>> Deletion anomaly.

>>D>> Update anomaly



5) Which of the following statement(s) is/are true for lossless join decomposition?

>>A>> It decomposes a relation into smaller relations, such that if we perform a natural join of smaller relations, it will return the original relation.

>>B>> It decomposes a relation into smaller relations, such that if we perform a natural join of the smaller relations, it will return more tuples than the original relation.

>>C>> It decomposes a relation into smaller relations, such that if we perform a natural join of the smaller relations, it will return lesser tuples than the original relation.

>>D>> It is effective in removing redundancy from databases while preserving the original data.



6) If a relation is in 1NF, then which of the following is/are true about the relation?

>>A>> The domains of all attributes of the relation are atomic.

>>B>> A relation in 1NF may contain one or more composite or multivalued attributes.

>>C>> In DBMS, we assume that all the relations are in 1NF, by default.

>>D>> The value of each attribute contains only a single value from that attributeâ€™s domain.


7) We want to store information about some books in a database. Every book has a unique ISBN, a name, a publisher and multiple authors. An author can also 
write multiple books. We consider the following two relations, each of which are in 1NF.

books { isbn, name, publisherisbn,name,publisher }
authors { isbn, authorisbn,author}

What should be the primary keys for the tables?

>>A>> isbn attribute for relation books and isbn for relation authors.

>>B>> publisher attribute for relationbooks and isbn for relation authors.

>>C>> publisher attribute for relation books and author for relation authors.

>>D>> isbn attribute for relation books and {isbn,author} for relation .authors.
