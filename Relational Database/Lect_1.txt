Reduancy : Multiple copies of Data
Anamoly : inconsistency of data arises due to change of data in data bases.



1) Which among the following is not a feature of a good database design?

>>A>> The design should provide efficient access to data.

>>B>> The design must promote redundant storage of the data items.

>>C>> The design must be clean, consistent, and easy to understand.

>>D>> The design must consider all expected data over time.



2) Which among the following statements is/are true about redundancy in databases?

>>A>> Redundancy may result in data anomaly.

>>b>> Redundancy may arise due to an un-normalized database.

>>C>> Redundancy mandates that a data item cannot have multiple copies in the database.

>>D>> Redundancy can be reduced by appropriate decomposition of relations.


3) Which of the following is not a data anomaly?

>>A>> Select anomaly

>>B>> Insertion anomaly.

>>C>> Deletion anomaly.

>>D>> Update anomaly



4) In a database, changing a single data may require changing many records, leading to the possibility of some changes being made incorrectly.
This situation can be described as ...............

>>A>> Select anomaly

>>B>> Insertions anomaly.

>>C>> Deletion anomaly.

>>D>> Update anomaly



5) Which of the following statement(s) is/are true for lossless join decomposition?

>>A>> It decomposes a relation into smaller relations, such that if we perform a natural join of smaller relations, it will return the original relation.

>>B>> It decomposes a relation into smaller relations, such that if we perform a natural join of the smaller relations, it will return more tuples than the original relation.

>>C>> It decomposes a relation into smaller relations, such that if we perform a natural join of the smaller relations, it will return lesser tuples than the original relation.

>>D>> It is effective in removing redundancy from databases while preserving the original data.



6) If a relation is in 1NF, then which of the following is/are true about the relation?

>>A>> The domains of all attributes of the relation are atomic.

>>B>> A relation in 1NF may contain one or more composite or multivalued attributes.

>>C>> In DBMS, we assume that all the relations are in 1NF, by default.

>>D>> The value of each attribute contains only a single value from that attributeâ€™s domain.


7) We want to store information about some books in a database. Every book has a unique ISBN, a name, a publisher and multiple authors. An author can also write multiple books. We consider the following two relations, each of which are in 1NF.

books { isbn, name, publisherisbn,name,publisher }
authors { isbn, authorisbn,author}

What should be the primary keys for the tables?

>>A>> isbn attribute for relation books and isbn for relation authors.

>>B>> publisher attribute for relationbooks and isbn for relation authors.

>>C>> publisher attribute for relation books and author for relation authors.

>>D>> isbn attribute for relation books and {isbn,author} for relation .authors.
